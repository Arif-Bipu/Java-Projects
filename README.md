# Overview
This repository will be a culmination of all of my projects completed in Java. These projects will involve creating applications, web servers, and any other projects I find an interest in.


## Projects Currently Completed
- **Event Driven Programming** - Involves developing a Java program that creates a standalone GUI application that simulates an e-store to add in stock items to a shopping cart and conclude the costs and invoice.
- **Multi Threaded Programming** - Involves developing a Java program with multiple threads of execution and synchronizing their access to necessary shared objects, specifically simulating a package shipping management system for an automated package shipping operation. 
- **Client Server Application Development** - Involves developing a Java program which is two-tiered involving Java and MySQL utilizing JDBC for connectivity. The program was a Java based GUI front-end with a back-end MySQL database connected via JDBC.
- **Three Tiered Web Application** - Involves developing a three tiered Java program involving Tomcat servers, Java, and MySQL via JDBC. The program was a supplier/shipment database as the back-end with a front-end access to the database occuring through the clients web browser. 
- **SneakyQueens** - Involves developing a Java program using data structures where a chess board of placed queens will be given and will need to be determined if they can attack one another. The program needs a worst-case runtime that does not exceed O(m+n). 
- **SneakyKnight** - Involves developing a Java program using data structures where a chess board of placed knights will be given and will need to be determined if they can attack one another or not. The program needs to have an average runtime that does not exceed O(nk) and worst case that does not exceed O(nk) where n is number of knights and k is max length of coordinate strings.
- **GenericBST** - Involves dmodifying a Java program working with generics an extending a binary search tree code from a data structure. There was also a requirement of no compile-time warnings with the change of the code.
