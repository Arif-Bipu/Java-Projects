# Overview
This repository will be a culmination of all of my projects completed in Java. These projects will involve creating applications, web servers, and any other projects I find an interest in.


## Projects Currently Completed
- **Event Driven Programming** - Involves developing a Java program that creates a standalone GUI application that simulates an e-store to add in stock items to a shopping cart and conclude the costs and invoice.
- **Multi Threaded Programming** - Involves developing a Java program with multiple threads of execution and synchronizing their access to necessary shared objects, specifically simulating a package shipping management system for an automated package shipping operation. 
- **Client Server Application Development** - Involves developing a Java program which is two-tiered involving Java and MySQL utilizing JDBC for connectivity. The program was a Java based GUI front end with a backend MySQL database connected via JDBC.
- **Three Tiered Web Application** - Involves developing a three tiered Java program involving Tomcat servers, Java, and MySQL via JDBC. The program was a supplier/shipment database as the back-end with a front-end access to the database occuring through the clients web browser.
